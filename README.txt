I am working on Open TD to refine my game programming ability on the client side, and to share my concepts with the world.

I will update this README with more details about the project in the near future.

To contact me about whatever email: Lucasacode@gmail.com 


This project uses the MIT license so feel free to do whatever you want with the code. Most of the graphical assets were obtained from the Unity Asset Store, and were free assets, I would recommend using your own graphical assets if you plan on publishing the game.

Cya!
