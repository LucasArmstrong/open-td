Open Source Tower Defense

This is a Tower Defense style game developed in Unity3D 5.3.4f1 with C#. Finally the tower defense source code you've been dreaming of.

I will update this README with more details about the project in the near future.

To contact me about whatever email: Lucasacode@gmail.com 


This project uses the MIT license so feel free to do whatever you want with the code. Most of the graphical assets were obtained from the Unity Asset Store, and were free assets, I would recommend using your own graphical assets if you plan on publishing the game.

Cya!
